JetPardy

A JeoPardy type of game made for educational purposes. All the coding is made in Python and HTML. 
The Python program can run by itself to play the game. The questions, answers and explanations are pre-written.
A webpage was made using HTML to show the UI of how we want the game to be displayed to the user.
The purpose of the program is that the user only enters the categories, and it automtically
uses web integration to create a jeopardy game, with random questions, answers and explanations to learn.

sources = Questions, Answers and Explanations were looked up in Google or made up by the team.

No copied codes from anywhere. But many functions and properties were looked online for guidance.
